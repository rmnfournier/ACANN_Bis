# Introduction
This repository contains all required steps to perform an analytic continuation on Quantum Monte Carlo Data. It is composed by the following folders :  

1. Quantum Monte Carlo     

This folder contains a naive implementation in c++ of a Quantum Monte Carlo algorithm that can serve as a template for generating data. 

2. MaxEnt    A naive implementation in MatLab of the Maximum Entropy method. This can be used as a benchmark for comparing Machine Learning Results  

3. Data   Contains a script that can generate data used to train and test neural networks.  4. Deep Learning  The methods used to train, save and use a Neural Network.
